# SPLICE Research Group Wiki Pages

**SPLICE** â€“ *Surrogate and Particle-in-Cell Learning, Innovation, and Code Exchange*

Welcome to the SPLICE Research Group wiki! This space serves as a collaborative platform for researchers working in the fields of machine learning, surrogate modelling, and Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations. Whether you are a group member or an external collaborator, we invite you to explore, contribute, and share knowledge.

## Contribution Guidelines

We encourage active participation from both group members and external collaborators. Before adding new content, please ensure that your contribution aligns with the goals of SPLICE and adheres to the following guidelines:

- Use markdown for formatting your pages.
- To ensure consistency across all wiki pages, we recommend the [markdownlint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint) VScode extension when editing the files locally. Once installed, markdownlint will automatically check your files for formatting issues as you edit.
- Keep your contributions focused on topics relevant to machine learning, surrogate modelling, or PIC codes.
- Ensure clarity and accuracy in your content.
- For external contributors, please obtain permission from the group administrators before making any changes.

If you're unsure about the process or need help with contributions, don't hesitate to ask for assistance on Slack or by email.
